# Advanced ML Second Assignment

## Overview
This assignment is divided into three main sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Statistical Tests, SQL Queries, and Deep Learning Model Implementation. Each section focuses on a specific dataset and aims to apply various data science techniques to derive insights and build models.

## Assignment Sections

### 1. EDA and Statistical Tests
- **Dataset**: Bank Marketing Dataset
- **Link**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](#)

#### Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Explore and clean the dataset, detailing imputation techniques and categorical encoding choices.

#### Feature Relations
- Investigate relationships between features using visualizations from Data to Viz. Justify the chosen graphs.

#### Time-Related Analysis
- Analyze time-related columns and their correlation with the target variable to uncover hidden insights.

#### Hypothesis Testing
- Understand the role of hypothesis tests in EDA and model building. Conduct tests on:
  - The effect of marital status on personal loan uptake.
  - The influence of previous marketing campaigns.
  - The relationship between job type and credit default.

#### Additional Hypothesis Tests
- Design two further tests to explore the dataset.

#### T-Tests
- Explain t-tests and their implications, conducting a one-sample t-test on the dataset.
- Identify two related numerical columns for paired t-tests, explaining the rationale and results.

#### Chi-Square Tests
- Define chi-square tests and their applications, conducting two tests and interpreting the results.

### 2. SQL
- **Dataset**: San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share Dataset
- **Link**: [Bike Share Dataset](#)

#### SQL Queries
- Retrieve IDs of bikes rented for over 10 days.
- Display the top 5 most frequently rented bikes with their rental counts.
- Get start and end station names for trips longer than 1 hour.
- Calculate total revenue per zip code for trips exceeding 30 minutes.
- Determine the percentage of trips subscribed by customers for each season (only trips over 15 minutes).
- Find the most popular station based on trip ratios.

### 3. Deep Learning
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10
- **Link**: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](#)

#### Model Implementation
- Implement two architectures using PyTorch:
  - **GoogLeNet**
  - **ResNet**  
> **Note**: Training for 2-3 epochs is sufficient. Implement lighter versions if needed.

## Requirements
- Code must be well-commented to enhance readability and understanding.
- While no formal reports are required, minimal documentation should accompany the code.
